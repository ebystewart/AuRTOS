# AuRTOS
An Open Source RTOS for Automotive Applications.

     The project is aimed at providing software resources for the development of automotive and industrial solutions based on renewable, non-pollutant and green technologies. I hope upon maturity, this project could encourage more enthusiast to try out newer solutions with a reliable, well written Real Time Operating System, kick-start and cut-down costs on commercial solutions.
     
     The objective is to develop an RTOS with the following capabilities and compliance.
     
     1. OSEK and AUTOSAR Compliance
     2. ISO 26262 Compliance
     3. Multicore SoC support - Initially Cortex - M core will be supported; The RTOS will be designed to be easily portable.
     4. Memory and Execution Time Protection
